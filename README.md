# Health Expenditure and Obesity Paradox

## Project Overview

Obesity is one of the most serious global health issues of our time.
Even though countries spend more on healthcare every year, obesity rates keep rising around the world.
This project explores why greater health spending does not necessarily lead to healthier outcomes.

By analyzing data on health expenditure, obesity rates, urbanization, GDP per capita, and social media usage, the study aims to uncover how modern lifestyles and digital habits contribute to this paradox.
The goal is to understand how factors like urban living and increased screen time affect public health and to highlight that reducing obesity requires more than just financial investment—it demands changes in behavior, environment, and awareness.

## Motivation

I’ve been curious about how our lifestyles and environments shape health outcomes. This project lets me explore that curiosity through data — connecting urbanization, social media use, and economic factors to global obesity trends. It’s a chance for me to improve my ability to analyze social and economic issues with real data while learning how modern habits influence public health.

## Data Source

Health Expenditure (% of GDP)	World Bank – 	Annual healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP.

Adult Obesity Rate (%)	Our World in Data (based on WHO Global Health Observatory) - Percentage of adults classified as obese in each country.

Urban Population (% of total)	World Bank – Share of the population living in urban areas.

GDP per Capita (current USD)	World Bank – Economic output per person, representing income levels.

Social Media Users (% of population)
DataReportal / We Are Social – Global Digital Overview Reports
Annual reports summarizing internet and social media penetration rates by country.

## Data Analysis

I will analyze how obesity rates change in relation to health expenditure, urbanization, and social media usage across different countries.
After cleaning and merging the datasets, I will perform several steps to identify key relationships and patterns.

* Correlation and Regression:
I will calculate correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
I will also run multiple regression models to test whether urbanization and digital engagement weaken the expected relationship between higher health spending and lower obesity rates.

* Comparative and Trend Analysis:
I will compare results between developed and developing countries to observe how economic differences affect this paradox.
I will analyze long-term patterns to see if increased spending eventually leads to lower obesity rates, or if modern digital lifestyles counteract these improvements.

* Visualization:
I will use regression plots, time-series charts, and heatmaps to summarize my findings and illustrate how modernization, lifestyle, and health investment interact in shaping public health outcomes.

## Hypothesis Testing

In this project, I will test whether higher health expenditure is actually associated with lower obesity rates, or if the opposite trend is true in modern societies.

Null Hypothesis (H₀):
Increased health expenditure leads to lower obesity rates across countries.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
Increased health expenditure does not reduce obesity rates and may even cause higher obesity prevalence, especially in highly urbanized and digitally active societies.

## Expected Outcome

I expect to find that higher health expenditure alone in the developed countries does not lead to lower obesity rates.
Instead, I believe that factors like urbanization and social media usage play a strong role in shaping this outcome.
