# Health Expenditure and Obesity Paradox

## Project Overview

Obesity is one of the most serious global health issues of our time.
Even though countries spend more on healthcare every year, obesity rates keep rising around the world.
This project explores why greater health spending does not necessarily lead to healthier outcomes.

By analyzing data on health expenditure, obesity rates, urbanization, GDP per capita, and social media usage, the study aims to uncover how modern lifestyles and digital habits contribute to this paradox.
The goal is to understand how factors like urban living and increased screen time affect public health and to highlight that reducing obesity requires more than just financial investment—it demands changes in behavior, environment, and awareness.

## Motivation

I’ve been curious about how our lifestyles and environments shape health outcomes. This project lets me explore that curiosity through data — connecting urbanization, social media use, and economic factors to global obesity trends. It’s a chance for me to improve my ability to analyze social and economic issues with real data while learning how modern habits influence public health.
